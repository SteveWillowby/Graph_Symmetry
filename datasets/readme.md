## temporal
- enron-exclusive
    - Has all emails sent BY and only-TO a select group of 148 key employees.
    - properties
        - directed, temporal
        - nodes: `148`
        - temporal emails (directed hyperedges): `9597`
        - time span: ~22.5 years
        - timestamp units are in seconds, assuming leap years every 4th year.
        - the first timestamp corresponds to 4PM PST December 31st, 1979
        - contains self-loops, in that a person can be a recipient of their own email
    - File Format: sender recipient-A recipient-B ... recipient-Z timestamp
    - The email address(es) associated with the node ids can be found in `email_address_labels.txt`
    - Raw data available at `https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/`
    - Code to convert the raw data into these graphs is found in `create_enron_graphs.py`
    - Last but not least, the records of certain external "shocks" are in `Relevant_Enron_Events.csv`
- enron-less-exclusive
    - Has all emails sent BY a group of 148 key employees, where at least one of the recipients is also in the group.
